# Encryption-Decryption_Assembly
The decrypting methods implemented are:
- XOR on two strings of bytes
- rolling XOR on a string of bytes
- XOR between two strings represented by hexadecimal characters
- Decrypting a string in a base32 representation.
- Bruteforce XOR with a 1 byte key. 
- Vigenere Cipher
